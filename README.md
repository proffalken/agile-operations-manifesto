# The Agile Operations Manifesto

This repository contains the documents that make up the Agile Operations
Manifesto.

It is hoped that by sharing these documents via an easy to update and edit
method such as source control, people will contribute and share their expertise
and improve on the original Author's thoughts.

## Contributing

The manifesto itself is contained within `manifesto.md` and supporting links
should be placed into the `supporting_documents.md` file under the appropriate
section header.

Please fork this repository and contribute back via a GitHb Pull Request,
making sure to include your name in the `authors.md` file so that attribution
can be given for the work you have proposed.

If you agree or disagree with a Pull Request, please add a comment as opposed
to a simple "+1" or "-1" so we understand why we should include/reject the
proposed idea.

Above all else, be kind. Constructive Criticism is valid, comments that
criticise without reason or any kind of personal attack will not be tolerated
and will be rejected when deciding whether to merge a PR or not.
